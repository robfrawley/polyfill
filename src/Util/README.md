Symfony Polyfill / Util
=======================

The [`symfony/polyfill`](https://github.com/symfony/polyfill) library backports
features found in the latest PHP versions and provides compatibility layers for
some extensions and functions.

The `util` component provides binary-safe string functions, using the 
[mbstring](https://php.net/mbstring) extension when available.

More information can be found in the [root README](../../README.md).
