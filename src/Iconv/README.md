Symfony Polyfill / Iconv
========================

The `[symfony/polyfill](https://github.com/symfony/polyfill)` library backports
features found in the latest PHP versions and provides compatibility layers for
some extensions and functions.

This `iconv` component provides a native PHP implementation of the
[php.net/iconv](http://php.net/iconv) functions
(short of [`ob_iconv_handler`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.ob-iconv-handler.php)).

More information can be found in the [root README](../README.md).
