Symfony Polyfill / Php56
========================

The [`symfony/polyfill`](https://github.com/symfony/polyfill) library backports
features found in the latest PHP versions and provides compatibility layers for
some extensions and functions.

The `php56` component provides functions unavailable in releases prior to PHP 5.6:

- `hash_equals`
- `ldap_escape` (part of [ldap](http://php.net/ldap) extension)

More information can be found in the [root README](../../README.md).
